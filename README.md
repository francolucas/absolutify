An Elixir app created for studies purpose that checks "real-time" the songs played in [Absolute Radio](https://absoluteradio.co.uk/absolute-radio/) and inserts into a specific Spotify playlist.

## Requirements

- Elixir 1.7
- [A registered Spotify App](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/app-settings/#register-your-app)

**Note:** If you need a "Redirect URI' for your Spotify App you can use this one: [http://absolutify.lucasfranco.com.br](http://absolutify.lucasfranco.com.br). The only thing this endpoint does is printing the `code` returned by the Spotify when the user authorizes the app access. For further documentation, you can check the Spotify [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).

*TODO: check the compatibility with different Elixir versions.*

## Usage

First, the user needs to authorize the app accessing a URL with the following format:
```
https://accounts.spotify.com/en/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=<app_client_id>&redirect_uri=<redirect_uri>&scope=playlist-read-private%20playlist-modify-private%20playlist-modify-public
```

With this URL, the user will give to the app the permission to read its playlists and modify the public and private ones.

After authorization, Spotify will redirect the user to the `redirect_uri` with the authorization code.

In `/config`, create a `config/secret.exs` file:

```elixir
use Mix.Config

config :absolutify,
  client_id: "<YOUR CLIENT ID>",
  secret_key: "<YOUR SECRET KEY>",
  callback_url: "<YOUR CALLBACK URL>",
  playlist_id: "<YOUR PLAYLIST ID>",
  code: "<THE AUTHORIZATION CODE GENERATED BY SPOTIFY WHEN YOU ALLOW THE APP>"
```

Now you can run Absolutify with the following command:

```bash
mix run --no-halt
```

Absolutify will use the `code` to connect to Spotify API, get the `access token` and renew it when necessary.

Each minute, Absolutify will do the following commands:
1. Checks the last song played at Absolute Radio and if it is different from the last check...
2. Searchs for the song in the Spotify and if exists...
3. Adds the song into the user's playlist.

## Next steps

- Write more tests.
- Start a web server to be the `redirect_uri` and receive the `code`.
- Since Absolute Radio returns a list of the latest played songs, parse the songs and connect to the Radio less often.
- Check if the song already exists in the playlist to avoid repeated songs.
- Separate the `GenServer` in two: one checking the played songs and another one to search and add the song in the Spotify playlist.
- Better error handling.
- Better logs.
- Deploy in a cloud server.
- Make it public.
